Team Name:  MAKES Change

Ameya Rao: Elaborated on and developed details for the Issues features, explaining how different datasets will be integrated together and what options the user can choose from
Emma Chun: Developed details for the Map/States Page, including identifying specific datasets and key features. Copied the Amazon skeleton into our repo for us to build off of. 
Michelle Qiu: Specified details for the committees page (how it will be implemented/designed, what data will be used)
Kieran Lele: Finalized multi selection for filtering on the policy implications page. Also set up base level visualization to handle aggregating amount donated to each candidate given the filters provided. 
Shravan Kalahasthy: Checked out the FEC data on individual contributions to each candidate. Currently figuring out how to scrape such a large amount of data.
