Ameya Rao: Cleaned data from Congressional history that outlines legislation that was voted on in the Senate, the sponsors of the legislation, and the relevant policy areas. Implemented a more advanced search function that allows users to see legislation in a policy area that is important to them that is sponsored by their senator.
Emma Chun: Cleaned and implemented real data into the States pages using FEC and MIT datasets. Added a feature allowing users to view data from specific Senate races in specific states by selecting a year. Added basic CSS.
Michelle Qiu: Gathered and organized over 17000 tuples of real data from FEC on committees and implemented into committee pages. Added additional functionalities (different ways to sort/display data, option to select categories of committees/recipients, ability to paginate through data, etc). Added feature to allow users to go to state election data based on the state that a committee is based in (if state data is available). Added CSS styling framework (see below for reference).
Kieran Lele: Finalized multi selection filtering on the policy implication page by allowing users to select which variables they wanted to filter on and then selecting from within those options. Secondly created a basic visualization component that aggregates data for each candidate within the filtering parameters based upon the selection criteria. Added some simple stylings as well.
Shravan Kalahasthy: First updated CSS on the home page. Then, cleaned and added over 1600000 tuples of real candidate voting data from Voteview. Then added functionality so a user can easily filter through a candidateâ€™s voting history. Lastly, created a drop down search bar so that a user can easily search for a candidate.
